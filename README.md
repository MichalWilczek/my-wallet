# My Wallet
Welcome to my web application, which monitors user spending periodically.

I developed this app to learn about the implementation of an MVC framework. Therefore, the app backend is inspired by Dave Hollingworth's courses, such as:

- [PHP MVC from scratch](https://www.udemy.com/course/php-mvc-from-scratch/)
- [PHP MVC login](https://www.udemy.com/course/php-mvc-login/)

I wrote this app in my spare time for fun and learning experience to understand another backend programming language such as PHP.

# Public link
The app is deployed to the public internet, and you can find the link [here](http://budget.michal-wilczek.profesjonalnyprogramista.pl/). Enjoy!

## Installation guide
The app works with PHP version 8.

To make it work, you need to add a file: /App/Config.php, allowing you to work locally or on the server. You can find an example [here](/App/ConfigExample.php).
